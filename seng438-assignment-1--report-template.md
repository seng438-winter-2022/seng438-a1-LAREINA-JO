# Introduction

This lab aims to practice the use of multiple testing methods including exploratory testing, manual functional testing and regression testing. The exploratory testing is not structured. Exploratory testers usually follow the objectives to test the important features of the application without planning and documentation. The manual scripted testing is more structured. It requires the testers to test the features of the application according to the test guide. The regression testing is always used to check whether there are the new errors or regressions after changes of the system or not.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Exploratory testing is a sort of manual testing that guides the testing process using the testers' experience and intuition rather than scripts. It's especially useful for discovering flaws that are missed by automated tests, testing UI aspects, and verifying that software satisfies its requirements. Exploratory testers are frequently directed by "charters," which outline the final testing goals but do not advise the tester what to do or where to focus.

The functions being tested druing the exploratory testing are:
    
    • logging into the system,

    • withdrawing, depositing, and transfering the correct amount of money,

    • showing the correct information in the balance inquiry.


In the exploratory testing, we decide to widely test the outlined functions. The outlined functions will be tested only once.

The designed test cases focus on the common paths of each outlined functionality which all the test inputs are legitimate.  

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

Manual testing of this sort is known as exploratory testing. It's usually done near the conclusion of software development lifecycles, and it goes hand in hand with the move toward scripting and automation — yet it couldn't be more unlike. Exploratory testing, rather than offering testers step-by-step scripts to test against, taps into their creative sides, relying on their expertise and intuition to steer the testing process and produce discoveries that scripts and automated tests would have missed.

Compared with manual scripted testing, unstructured exploratory testing is able to find major issues of the system quickly and may discover bugs from test cases that are not covered in the manual script. Thus, exploratory testing has a higher efficiency but lower effectiveness to fulfill all the system requirements.

The manual scripted testing is designed to cover the basic system functionality. It has high testing effectiveness since most usage paths and functionalities will be tested. Meanwhile, a large amount of testing increases repeatability and time consumption.


# Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports

For each defeat report, every group member shall review the backlog notes and retest on their own computer. If a dissension appears, the whole group will discuss the procedure and results. Eventually, all defeat reports are unified into the same format.

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

For the exploratory testing. The first pair, Brian and Zheng, and the second pair, Rui and Weitao, separately test and report to the backlog.  Test cases were divided equally into 10 cases per team member and then bug reports were peer reviewed and retested by every team member. The final report is written, edited, and checked by all group members.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

During the covid pandemic, the pair and group testing are not practicable face to face. The backlog website and sufficient communication among group members help to gather ideas and share work. As we initially used the backlog, we didn't handle the functionalities in backlog well due to the unfamiliarity. But the lab document shows the very detailed steps about how to operate the functions in the website. After learning from the guide, we could handle the backlog website easily.
This first assignment provides a great insight to software testing whether on testing formats and procedures or group testing experience.

# Comments/feedback on the lab and lab document itself

This lab is meaningful because it practiced three kinds of testing skills that we have learned. It also helps us develop the skills of co-opearateing with other teammates since it requires us to work as a pair. In the future assignment, hopefully there will be more chances to practice our teamwork skills. The lab document shows very detailed definition of the terms and precise steps. Overall, the lab document works as a guide very well.
